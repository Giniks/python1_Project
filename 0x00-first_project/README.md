## Project Topic: WElCOME PACK

## Overview
- This is my first ever python project I did with 100 days of python coding. This is basically welcome pack to users of band name generator, where i asked the userd to input their cities and pet names to generate a band name. I also store these functions in a variable to be able to modify, call back, and add the function in another function like the print function.
