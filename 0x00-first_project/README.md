## About This Project
Welcome, everyone, to my very first Python project! This project marks the beginning of my coding journey and showcases my initial steps into the fascinating world of Python programming. As a beginner, I've poured my heart and soul into creating this project, and I'm thrilled to share it with you all.

## Overview
All the projects are crucial and will advance my skills from beginner's level  to advance level. Through this project, I've gained valuable hands-on experience in Python programming, honed my problem-solving skills, and laid the foundation for future coding endeavors.

## Project Description
- This is my first ever python project I did with 100 days of python coding. This is basically welcome pack to users of band name generator, where i asked the users to input their cities and pet names to generate their band names. I also stored these functions in some variables to be able to modify, call back, and add these functions in another function like the print function. 

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python [Version 3.8]
- **Libraries/Modules:** [\incoming as I progress]

## How to Run the Project
All the project files are executable.

## Future Improvements
While I'm proud of what I've accomplished with this project, there's always room for improvement.
